    "The overall goal is to provide an understanding of how to think through\n",
    "collecting, analyzing, and interpreting multi-echo fMRI data.\n",

    "but we also include equations to support people who want to understand\n",
    "multi-echo fMRI at a deeper level.\n",
    "Whenever we include equations, we try to explain the take-home message\n",
    "so that readers can follow the overall message without needing to study\n",
    "and understand every equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This book covers several topics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- How to install the data and programs needed for running interactive examples\n",
    "- Information for understanding and thinking about acquiring multi-echo fMRI\n",
    "- How multi-echo information can be used to support noise removal in data\n",
    "- Examples and pipelines for processing and visualizing multi-echo data using multiple tools, such as AFNI, fMRIPrep and tedana."
